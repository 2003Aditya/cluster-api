### Suggested changes for providers

- From Cluster API v1.7 the manager pods are created with `terminationMessagePolicy` set to `FallbackToLogsOnError` for the manager container. This offers the chance that the pod's termination message will contain something useful if the manager exits unexpectedly, which in turn makes debugging easier. We also recommend this setting to provider managers. For an example, see the corresponding change in [CAPV](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/pull/2988) or [CAPO](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-openstack/pull/2070).
